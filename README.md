## Unwrapping Cubesat!
![cubesat image shortened](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/010089f9-3cf1-4272-8012-e810ffe9565f)

CubeSats are small satellites that have been standardized in size, hence attracting considerable attention for their revolutionary nature within space industry technology. These CubeSats basically originated as 1U CubeSats, having dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm and weighing around 1‚Äì1.33 kg, with ongoing efforts to make them lighter over time to meet the demand for more advanced capabilities. Due to the increasing need for more superior functionalities, larger designs, such as the 3U CubeSat, have been adopted, meaning three 1U CubeSat units are stacked vertically.

## More about Cubesat

Professors Jordi Puig-Suari of California Polytechnic State University and Bob Twiggs of Stanford University proposed the CubeSat reference design in 1999[9][10]:‚Ää159‚Ää with the aim of enabling graduate students to design, build, test and operate in space a spacecraft with capabilities similar to that of the first spacecraft, Sputnik. The CubeSat, as initially proposed, did not set out to become a standard; rather, it became a standard over time by a process of emergence. The first CubeSats launched in June 2003 on a Russian Eurockot, and approximately 75 CubeSats had entered orbit by 2012.[11]

The need for such a small-factor satellite became apparent in 1998 as a result of work done at Stanford University's Space System Development Laboratory. At SSDL, students had been working on the OPAL (Orbiting Picosatellite Automatic Launcher) microsatellite since 1995. OPAL's mission to deploy daughter-ship "picosatellites" had resulted in the development of a launcher system that was "hopelessly complicated" and could only be made to work "most of the time". With the project's delays mounting, Twiggs sought DARPA funding that resulted in the redesign of the launching mechanism into a simple pusher-plate concept with the satellites held in place by a spring-loaded door.[10]:‚Ää151‚Äì157‚Ää

Desiring to shorten the development cycle experienced on OPAL and inspired by the picosatellites OPAL carried, Twiggs set out to find "how much could you reduce the size and still have a practical satellite". The picosatellites on OPAL were 10.1 cm √ó 7.6 cm √ó 2.5 cm (4 in √ó 3 in √ó 1 in), a size that was not conducive to covering all sides of the spacecraft with solar cells. Inspired by a 4 in (10 cm) cubic plastic box used to display Beanie Babies in stores,[6] Twiggs first settled on the larger ten-centimeter cube as a guideline for the new CubeSat concept. A model of a launcher was developed for the new satellite using the same pusher-plate concept that had been used in the modified OPAL launcher. Twiggs presented the idea to Puig-Suari in the summer of 1999 and then at the Japan‚ÄìU.S. Science, Technology and Space Applications Program (JUSTSAP) conference in November 1999.[10]:‚Ää157‚Äì159‚Ää

The term "CubeSat" was coined to denote nanosatellites that adhere to the standards described in the CubeSat design specification. Cal Poly published the standard in an effort led by aerospace engineering professor Jordi Puig-Suari.[12] Bob Twiggs, of the Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University, and currently a member of the space science faculty at Morehead State University in Kentucky, has contributed to the CubeSat community.[13] His efforts have focused on CubeSats from educational institutions.[14] The specification does not apply to other cube-like nanosatellites such as the NASA "MEPSI" nanosatellite, which is slightly larger than a CubeSat. GeneSat-1 was NASA's first fully automated, self-contained biological spaceflight experiment on a satellite of its size. It was also the first U.S.-launched CubeSat. This work, led by John Hines at NASA Ames Research, became the catalyst for the entire NASA CubeSat program.[15]

In 2017, this standardization effort led to the publication of ISO 17770:2017 by the International Organization for Standardization.[16] This standard defines specifications for CubeSats including their physical, mechanical, electrical, and operational requirements.[17] It also provides a specification for the interface between the CubeSat and its launch vehicle, which lists the capabilities required to survive the environmental conditions during and after launch and describes the standard deployment interface used to release the satellites. The development of standards shared by a large number of spacecraft contributes to a significant reduction in the development time and cost of CubeSat missions.
