## Unwrapping Cubesat!
CubeSats are small satellites that have been standardised in size hence attracting a considerable amount of attention for their revolutionary class nature within space industry technology. These cubesats basically originated as 1U cubesat having dimensions of 10cmx10cmx10cm and weighing around 1-1.33kg at least and still being made lighter with time in order to meet demand for more advance capabilities. This is because due to an increasing need for more superior functionalities they have adopted larger designs such as 3U cubesat meaning three such 1U cubesat units put together vertically.
