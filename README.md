## 🎁 Unboxing Cubesat!

CubeSats are small satellites that have been standardized in size, hence attracting considerable attention for their revolutionary nature within space industry technology. These CubeSats basically originated as 1U CubeSats, having dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm and weighing around 1–1.33 kg, with ongoing efforts to make them lighter over time to meet the demand for more advanced capabilities. Due to the increasing need for more superior functionalities, larger designs, such as the 3U CubeSat, have been adopted, meaning three 1U CubeSat units are stacked vertically.

## 🛰 More about Cubesat
As is generally understood, the position of an element is indicated as spanning from a start tag and is terminated by an end tag.[1] This is the case for many, but not all, elements within an HTML document. The distinction is explicitly emphasised in HTML 4.01 Specification:

Elements are not tags. Some people refer to elements as tags (e.g., "the P tag"). Remember that the element is one thing, and the tag (be it start or end tag) is another. For instance, the HEAD element is always present, even though both start and end HEAD tags may be missing in the markup.[1]

Similarly the W3C Recommendation HTML 5.1 2nd Edition explicitly says:

Tags are used to delimit the start and end of elements in the markup. (...) The start and end tags of certain normal elements can be omitted, (...)
The contents of the element must be placed between just after the start tag (which might be implied, in certain cases) and just before the end tag (which again, might be implied, in certain cases).

— HTML 5.1 2nd Edition § 8.1.2. Elements § Tags
and:

Certain tags can be omitted.
NOTE:
Omitting an element's start tag (...) does not mean the element is not present; it is implied, but it is still there. For example, an HTML document always has a root <html> element, even if the string <html> doesn't appear anywhere in the markup.

— HTML 5.1 2nd Edition § 8.1.2.4. Optional tags

As HTML (before HTML5) is based on SGML,[2] its parsing also depends on the Document Type Definition (DTD), specifically an HTML DTD (e.g. HTML 4.01[3][note 1]). The DTD specifies which element types are possible (i.e. it defines the set of element types) and also the valid combinations in which they may appear in a document. It is part of general SGML behavior that, where only one valid structure is possible (per the DTD), its explicit statement in any given document is not generally required. As a simple example, the <p> tag indicating the start of a paragraph element should be complemented by a </p> tag indicating its end. But since the DTD states that paragraph elements cannot be nested, an HTML document fragment <p>Para 1 <p>Para 2 <p>Para 3 is thus inferred to be equivalent to <p>Para 1 </p><p>Para 2 </p><p>Para 3. (If one paragraph element cannot contain another, any currently open paragraph must be closed before starting another.) Because this implication is based on the combination of the DTD and the individual document, it is not usually possible to infer elements from document tags alone but only by using an SGML—or HTML—aware parser with knowledge of the DTD. HTML5 creates a similar result by defining what tags can be omitted.[4]
