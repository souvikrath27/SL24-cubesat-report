CubeSats are small satellites that have been standardized in size, hence attracting considerable attention for their revolutionary nature within space industry technology. These CubeSats basically originated as 1U CubeSats, having dimensions of 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm and weighing around 1–1.33 kg, with ongoing efforts to make them lighter over time to meet the demand for more advanced capabilities. Due to the increasing need for more superior functionalities, larger designs, such as the 3U CubeSat, have been adopted, meaning three 1U CubeSat units are stacked vertically.
